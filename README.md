* [Image classification](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/image-classification): Build a convolutional neural network with TensorFlow to classify CIFAR-10 images.
* [Text Generation](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/tv-script-generation): Train a recurrent neural network on scripts from The Simpson's (copyright Fox) to generate new scripts.
* [Machine Translation](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/language-translation): Train a sequence to sequence network for English to French translation (on a simple dataset)
* [Face Generation](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/face_generation): Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of novel and realistic human faces.


## Dependencies

Each directory has a `requirements.txt` describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks in that directory.

### pip

To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

### Conda Environments

You can find Conda environment files for the Deep Learning program in the `environments` folder. Note that environment files are platform dependent. Versions with `tensorflow-gpu` are labeled in the filename with "GPU".
